Sure! Here's a simple task for beginners to create a basic e-commerce API:

**Task: Create a Basic E-commerce API**

**Objective:** Develop a simple RESTful API for managing products in an e-commerce store.

**Requirements:**
1. Use Node.js with Express.js for building the API.
2. Implement CRUD operations for products (Create, Read, Update, Delete).
3. Use in-memory storage (e.g., an array) for storing product data.
4. Include basic validation for input data (e.g., required fields, data types).
5. Use meaningful HTTP status codes for responses (e.g., 200 for success, 404 for not found, 400 for bad request).
6. Document the API endpoints using a README.md file.

**API Endpoints:**

1. **GET /products**: Retrieve all products.
2. **GET /products/:id**: Retrieve a single product by ID.
3. **POST /products**: Create a new product.
4. **PUT /products/:id**: Update an existing product by ID.
5. **DELETE /products/:id**: Delete a product by ID.

**Example Request and Response:**

1. **GET /products**
   - Request: `GET /products`
   - Response:
     ```json
     [
       {
         "id": 1,
         "name": "Product 1",
         "price": 10.99,
         "description": "This is the first product"
       },
       {
         "id": 2,
         "name": "Product 2",
         "price": 19.99,
         "description": "This is the second product"
       }
     ]
     ```

2. **GET /products/:id**
   - Request: `GET /products/1`
   - Response:
     ```json
     {
       "id": 1,
       "name": "Product 1",
       "price": 10.99,
       "description": "This is the first product"
     }
     ```

3. **POST /products**
   - Request:
     ```json
     {
       "name": "New Product",
       "price": 15.99,
       "description": "This is a new product"
     }
     ```
   - Response:
     ```json
     {
       "id": 3,
       "name": "New Product",
       "price": 15.99,
       "description": "This is a new product"
     }
     ```

4. **PUT /products/:id**
   - Request: `PUT /products/3`
     ```json
     {
       "name": "Updated Product",
       "price": 19.99,
       "description": "This is an updated product"
     }
     ```
   - Response:
     ```json
     {
       "id": 3,
       "name": "Updated Product",
       "price": 19.99,
       "description": "This is an updated product"
     }
     ```

5. **DELETE /products/:id**
   - Request: `DELETE /products/3`
   - Response: Status 204 No Content

**README.md:**

Include instructions on how to run the server, descriptions of each endpoint, and example requests and responses as demonstrated above.

This task provides a basic foundation for beginners to understand RESTful API development and practice CRUD operations.
